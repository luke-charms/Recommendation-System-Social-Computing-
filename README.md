A coursework for the Social Computing program at the University of Southampton, which involved making two different recommender systems 
that could take in large matrixes of user data and output a recommended item based on that user's data.
The first system (titled 'CW1') uses a simple cosine-similarity index to measure how cloe the user's scores are to that of the already
existing values in the matrix.
The second system (titled 'CW2') uses a matrix factorisation function that takes all the values in the database into consideration and
can match the predicted scores of items to that of the user.
